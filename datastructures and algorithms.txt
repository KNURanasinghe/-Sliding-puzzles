Data Structures:
2D Array (char[][]):

Represents the game map where each character represents a cell with specific properties like walls, start ('S'), finish ('F'), or empty spaces.
Queue (ArrayDeque):

Used for the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting point to the finish point.
Phaser:

Used for synchronizing player movements and game state changes.
Algorithms:
Breadth-First Search (BFS):
Used to find the shortest path from the starting point ('S') to the finish point ('F') on the game map.
Other Components:
Swing Components:

The application uses Swing components such as JPanel, JFrame, and JOptionPane for GUI.
Key Listeners:

Implements KeyListener interface to handle keyboard inputs for moving the player character.
File Handling:

Reads map files from the file system and loads them into the game map data structure.
Graphics Drawing:

Uses Java's Graphics class to draw the game map, player character, walls, start, finish, and other game elements on the screen.
User Interaction:

Shows dialog boxes using JOptionPane for selecting game type, map selection, and displaying game over messages.
