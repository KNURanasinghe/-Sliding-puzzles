**Sliding Puzzle Solver**

This repository contains code for solving sliding puzzles commonly found in video games. The basic version of the puzzle involves navigating a player character from a starting point (labeled "S") to a finish point (labeled "F") on a grid filled with obstacles. The player can only move in the four cardinal directions, and they will continue sliding until they hit a wall or obstacle.

### Contents:
